1 open runner.jar file. in terminal  write command   java -jar runner.jar  
there 3 argument :  
arg[0]  is client thread number
arg[1]  is server thread number
arg[2]  is running  time

for example 
java -jar runner.jar 10 5  5  
means  10 client thread number 5 server thread number and 5 running time

the result will be in the last line.

For some reason, if may get some exception, it might be some thread is not relase, just quit and run again, it will be fine.
